As we study these skills, we will see how they interact with each other to create effective interdependence.  Or else I should find some kind of motivating training program that gets them to work harder.  Try it in your marriage, family, work.  Where did I have breakfast today and with whom? Have I spent the whole morning in class? When was lunch break? Who did I have lunch with? What was the conversation about? What did I do after lunch? How did I entertain myself in the evening? With whom? What were we talking about? ..But most of all, she wants to know - although she does not ask directly about it - who can be called to check everything I tell her.  Those of us who followed the flight of Apollo 11 were shocked to see the first humans land on the moon and then return to Earth.  And yet we love, no matter what. </p>
